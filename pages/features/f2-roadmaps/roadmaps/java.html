            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. </p>

                            <p>A package is a namespace that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class ArrayList is in the package java.util. For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.<br><br>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p>

                            <p>Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program<br><br>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p>
