            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. </p>

For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.<br><br>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p>

Similarly, in programming like Java, a function method is a block of code written to perform a specific task repeatedly. It provides reusability of code. We write the function once and use it many times.<br><br>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p>

                                <p>Object-oriented programming is a core of Java Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects. This can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.<br><br>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p>

                                <p>A package is a namespace that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class ArrayList is in the package java.util. For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.<br><br>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p>
